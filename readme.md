sl1p is a software pipeline designed to simply the processing of 16S rRNA (and other marker gene) sequencing data by automating quality control, the picking of operational taxonomic units, and taxonomic assignment. sl1p also performs some basic analyses of the dataset, including an R markdown file which can aid the user in furthering these analyses. sl1p is publically available for any use and is maintained.

For information on installation and requirements, see `INSTALL.txt`.

For a comprehensive manual of sl1p, see `README.txt`. For any additional inquires or to report any bugs or errors, please use the Issues tab.
